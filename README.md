This repository consists of the source code solutions to all the assignments I solved in order to complete the Fundamentals of Scalable Data Science course offered by IBM, upon successful completion of which I was awarded with the digital IBM badge. Over the course of this work, I learned to work with Apache Spark (specifically PySpark) on IBM Cloud and learned about RDD and DataFrame APIs.
